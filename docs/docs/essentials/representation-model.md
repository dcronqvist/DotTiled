# Representation model

Tiled map files contain various types of data, such as tilesets, layers, and object groups. The representation model is a way to represent this data in a structured way. By using the `.tmx` file format as inspiration, the representation model is a collection of classes which mimic the structure of a Tiled map file.

Certain properties throughout the representation model are marked as _optional_ by being either wrapped in a <xref:DotTiled.Optional`1> or by having a set default value.

- Properties that make use of the [required](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/required) keyword must be present in the file, otherwise an error will be raised.
- Properties that have default values will use the default value if the property is not present in the file, and are not marked as required or optional since you must not provide a value for them.
- Properties that are wrapped in <xref:DotTiled.Optional`1> may or may not be present in the file, and have no default value.

## Version compatibility

The representation model is designed to be compatible with the latest version of Tiled. This means that it may not be able to read files from older versions of Tiled, or files that use features that are not yet supported by the representation model. However, here is a table of which versions of Tiled are supported by which versions of DotTiled.

You should use one of the versions of DotTiled that is compatible with the version of Tiled you are using.

| Tiled version  | Compatible DotTiled version(s) |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1.11.1, 1.11.2 | 0.4.0, 1.0.0                   |
| 1.11           | 0.1.0, 0.2.0, 0.2.1, 0.3.0     |
